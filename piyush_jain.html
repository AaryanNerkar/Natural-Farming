</header>
<div class="space-y-6 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
<div style="position: relative; top: -375px;">
<p>Piyush Jain currently works as a SAP consultant at Accenture, where he is responsible for creating a detailed blueprint for the development requirements of S/4HANA and for providing business and functional support around SAP modules. Despite his busy corporate schedule, he has been passionately practicing natural farming in Jalgaon, demonstrating a perfect balance between modern work life and sustainable agriculture. </p>

<h3 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight border-l-4 border-primary pl-4">Embracing Natural Farming</h3>
<div style="position: relative; top: 20px;">
<p>He began his journey into natural farming in 2018, inspired by his father, who had left their village for a job when Piyush was in the 4th grade. After his father’s retirement, the family decided to return to their village to take up farming. They received training in organic farming and officially started their natural farming journey in 2018. They were the only family in their village practicing natural farming at that time.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight border-l-4 border-primary pl-4">Achievements and Techniques</h3>
<div style="position: relative; top: 20px;">
<p>Initially, many people doubted their efforts, saying that natural farming would not work, especially since their land was not very fertile. It was a struggle, but over time, they began to see remarkable results—the soil became more fertile, and their crops started surviving even during heavy rains and other adverse conditions. At first, they practiced natural farming only for their own use, but later they decided to extend their efforts for the benefit of society—to help nature through sustainable farming and to provide people with healthy, naturally grown food. Through the Healthy Food Bank, founded by Mrs. Prathibha Patil, Piyush gained recognition and appreciation for his work. Over time, he achieved both personal satisfaction and economic prosperity through his dedication to natural farming.</p>

<div style="position: relative; top: 40px;">

<p>By practicing natural farming and selling their produce through the Healthy Food Bank, farmers find their lives much easier. Currently, Piyush has established four more groups in Pashan, Suzgaon, Rahatani, and Hinjewadi to help natural farmers sell their food items directly to customers. These groups operate without any commissions, allowing farmers to retain the full benefit of their produce. Initially, participation was low, but over time, more people have shown interest, and volunteers are now reaching out to join and support these initiatives.</p>
